During the Career Center presentation by Megan Goeke
one thing in particular stood out to me.  Questions are extremely important in getting your foot in the door when it comes to interviews.  
These questions must be carefully formulated and asked to be effective.  Open ended questions work much better than close ended questions because they make the interviewer tell a story that can tell 
more about the workplace in question while also showing that you are interested in the job for more than just the paycheck.  After they answer the question, responding with another question is one of 
the best ways to keep the conversation going and build a relationship with the interviewer, which helps them to keep you in mind when it comes to choosing who to hire.
